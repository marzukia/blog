I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the greatest fan of politics, in a normal scenario I'd avoid talking about it like the plague. However, as the elections have come and gone, it'd be sacrilege for me to pretend the goldmine of electoral data now available did not exist.

In this case, my love for all things data outweighs my disdain for politics. So I thought, why not make it fun?

In sports like Basketball, there are a litany of metrics which can give a different perspective on how good a player really is. You have your standard metrics like Points per Game, or Assists per Game but you also have metrics such as


| Party Name      | Seats | Votes   | Donations (18-19) | $/Seat     | $/Vote |
|-----------------|-------|---------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| National Party  | 35    | 638393  | $1,963,782.23     | $56,108.06 | $3.08  |
| Labour Party    | 64    | 1169397 | $957,262.70       | $14,957.23 | $0.82  |
| Green Party     | 10    | 180224  | $942,746.53       | $94,274.65 | $5.23  |
